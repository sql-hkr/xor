This repository was developed to help students and beginners learn about neural networks through step-by-step visualization of the training process ([sql-hkr.github.io/xor/](http://sql-hkr.github.io/xor/)). It supports the XOR dataset as well as other datasets, including “spiral”, “circles”, and “gaussians”.

I hope this will be helpful for students and beginners learning about neural networks.

Feel free to ask me anything at @sql-hkr.
